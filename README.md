# Java TNT
Minecraft Bedrock Edition add-on that makes TNT behavior similar to Java Edition (ie. TNT explosion will drop all blocks).

## __This is a work in progress!__
Please let me know if you find any issues. I will try my best to fix them asap.

## Purpose
This add-on will allow you to build automatic tree farms, cobblestone farms and more.

## Note
To use this addon, you will need to enable experimental gameplay in world settings.

## Problems
1. Not all blocks have been tested.
2. Blocks that drop items (coal ore for example) will drop the block instead.
3. Blocks with additional data values (eg. colored concrete) may not drop the correct block.
4. Some items will drop that should not (eg. nether sprouts)
